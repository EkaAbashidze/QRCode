## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties



### What I learned

I learned to create a card, align it, its items and text in center, insert image,
make its overflow hidden, add colors to the whole background, text, and container.



### Continued development

I hope to create this kind of cards with ease in the future.

### Useful resources

Mostly I took upon from what I remembered was explained at the lecture, I did not
need to watch it again so I felt at ease with it, and then I added what was left for me to do.
